# Online-Recycling-Service-Project-Management-

1.	Purpose 

People tend to have more clothes than they need and are more indulgent in the process of buying more clothes than ever considering an appropriate way to get rid of their existing unworthy, non-trendy, excessive or simply outgrown clothes. 

This leads to every house and individual having extra clothes that can be recycled/upcycled or donated to the needful. But there is not an existing simple & reliable way that makes this process easy and which can be done from home. The purpose of this project is to solve this problem.

2.	Objective

This project aims to build a web/app service that will be a portal to recycling/upcycling or donating any extra clothing which the user has. There are existent slow, local and unreliable ways that try to solve this problem but aren’t successful in solving the problem at a larger global scale along with maintaining the trust factor. The project aims to deliver this service globally and make it 100% transparent to the user how their clothing is being of use to the needful or being upcycled/recycled for better usage. 

The recipient of the project is essentially is an individual user. The user won’t be paying any fee for this service, the purpose of which is to align with the idea of recycling/ upcycling and donating clothing where necessary for goodwill and sustainability. This will also boost user counts to a higher degree.

3.	Scope

The scope of this project is to create an online service primarily a website which will offer options like recycling, upcycling and donation options to the user. The clothes will then be reverse supply chained to recycling stations, or upcycling warehouses. 

If the user chooses to donate, a preferable charity purpose can be chosen to the likes of the user and the clothes will then be delivered to that particular chosen donation drive. This reverse supply chain will be done by an external service which will be on contract, like DHL, UPS or USPS. We will also create an android/ iPhone application that would be the counterpart of the web service. The user can also choose a subscription model which will collect the extra clothes in regular time intervals as preferred by them. 

4.	Funding Plan

The funder for this project will be a venture capital firm or angel investor looking to make a seed investment in an early-stage online service company. In the initial stages, the venture capitalist or the angel investor will be interested in getting their investment back multiplied. In the further stages they will be interested in higher returns when the company has scaled sufficiently. 

Specifically, the clothing industry brands would use our clothes to produce their sustainable line of clothes. Clothing brands, to support sustainable and green initiatives do not use any products which would harm the environment, our project will deliver such clothes to them in return for payment. Apart from this the government would be interested in funding this initiative as part of solving a sustainability issue. Apart from this the project will get major endorsements from celebrities or influential people to support the green initiative.
